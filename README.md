# antlr4-vba

ANTLR classes to allow Python to parae VBA source code. Note that the classes are autogenerated by the build script when the release is triggered, so there is no actual python code here. The .py files are only in the release and are accompanied typed interface files for mypy.

These scripts can be easily modified to create packages for any target language.
