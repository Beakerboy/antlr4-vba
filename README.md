# antlr4-vba

This project includes ANTLR classes to allow Python to parse VBA source code. Note that the classes are autogenerated by a build script when the release is triggered, so there is no actual python code at the repository. The .py files are only in the release and are accompanied with typed interface files for mypy.

The generating scripts can be easily modified to create packages for any target language.
